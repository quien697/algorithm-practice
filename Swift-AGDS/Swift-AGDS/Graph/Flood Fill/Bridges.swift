/// Thereâ€™s a country made up of several islands. The president of this country promised people that he would build bridges to connect the islands. However, after he got re-elected he started thinking that it would be a waste to build all the bridges. One day he came to the conclusion that he can get away by building only one bridge (shortest). This country can be represented by N x N grid as below (There are 3 islands). Gray square = land, White square = ocean
/// In order to build the shortest bridge
/// Given a `N x N` grid map, write a program to get the length of the shortest bridge.
/// * Input Specification
/// First line: `N (size of the map, 1 <= N <= 100)`
/// Next N lines of data.
/// * Output Specification
/// The shortest length
